         MTP will subtract this value from the free space it reports back
         to the host via GetStorageInfo, and will not allow new files to
         be added via MTP if there is less than this amount left free in the storage.
         Since MTP is sharing storage with the rest of the system, we are reserving
         100 megabytes of space to ensure that MTP activity does not result in the
         storage being too close to full. -->
